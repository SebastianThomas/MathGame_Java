# MathGame_Java
This game was created by Sebastian Thomas. It uses Java (and Javax!!!) for inputs. 

You do just have to enter 
  1. your names, 
  2. the points each category should give and 
  3. some results. 

The software will tell you who has won. 
The game is in German, but Google Translator should help.... ;-)

I created this game because my class played a game in the Math-hour. I've thought that it should be easier to play this game. 
Normally it was to learn how to calculate the standard deviation (German -> Standardabweichung), now you don't have to calculate anything anymore. 
I don't think anyone in my class would have a problem with that (except the math-teacher, of course). But when I finished it we did already have another topic. I'm going to see if I could present it to my class.  

This was/is my first "real" application. For example during my first internship I did a website; but just on localhost; and it doesn't work to 100% properly... Furthermore there is an .exe and a .jar-file so that you can just open it without the console with tow clicks. 
So this here is my first stable, working (and public) application.
