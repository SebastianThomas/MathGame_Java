# MathGame_Java
This game was created by Sebastian Thomas. It uses Java (and Javax!!!) for inputs. 

You do just have to enter 
  1. your names, 
  2. the points each category should give and 
  3. some results. 

The software will tell you who has won. 
The game is in German, but Google Translator should help.... ;-)
